# Kikofri

Kikofri is a theme for Jekyll that's a fork of the [Kiko theme](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) by  [@gfjaru](https://twitter.com/gfjaru) (which I do recommend). 

It came about because I my themes like I like my music: ugly, old and barren. It's an assortment of hacks filtered through web-design choices from the turn of the millenium.

## To do:
