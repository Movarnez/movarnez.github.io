# K I K O F R I

Kikofri is a theme for Jekyll that's a fork of the [Kiko theme][1] It came
about because I like my themes like I like my music: ugly, old and barren. It's
an assortment of hacks filtered through web-design choices from the turn of the
millennium.

More information about the theme and it's quirks can be found [here][2.1]. A
lot of stuff has changed since the last update, '[Kikofri Classic][2.3]' if you
will. Even more importantly, a lot of junk got dumped and other junk got
simplified.

You'll see it undead [here][2.2].
